# Project2-472

# Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to implement threading, file processing and multiprocessing on dataset for forest fires. We want to perform these operations on the data so we can simulate fire spreads and generate emergency alerts when a threshhold is passed. There will be alerts for dangerous conditions that correlate with fire spreads such as high temperatures, low humidities or high winds.
