# Project2-472

# Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to implement threading, file processing and multiprocessing on dataset for forest fires. We want to perform these operations on the data so we can simulate fire spreads and generate emergency alerts when a threshhold is passed. There will be alerts for dangerous conditions that correlate with fire spreads such as high temperatures, low humidities or high winds.

# Significance of the project

This project demonstrates the integration of multithreading in C for real-time data processing, specifically focused on fire risk assessment based on environmental sensor data. The system processes data (temperature, wind speed, humidity, and the fire spread index) and triggers alerts if certain thresholds are exceeded, indicating heightened fire risk. This approach can be applied in wildfire management systems, providing real-time alerts and early warnings, potentially saving lives and property by improving response times to fire outbreaks.

# Showcasing the achievement of project goals
We see this project as a huge success especially for people that live or work up in the fire towers in recreational parks. This project can be a great tool to help these workers detect a potential forest fire before it event starts. By keeping track and reporting their daily weather journals, they can prepare for the worst with our tool. The built in alerts can keep emergency protocols at the ready.
